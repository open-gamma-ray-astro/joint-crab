# VERITAS data

[VERITAS (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array
System)](https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/) is a ground-based gamma-ray
instrument operating at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) in southern
Arizona, USA. It is an array of four 12m optical reflectors for gamma-ray
astronomy in the GeV - TeV energy range. These imaging Cherenkov telescopes are
deployed such that they have the highest sensitivity in the VHE energy band (50
GeV - 50 TeV), with maximum sensitivity from 100 GeV to 10 TeV. This VHE
observatory effectively complements the NASA Fermi mission.

VERITAS  is supported by grants from the U.S. Department of Energy Office of
Science, the U.S. National Science Foundation and the Smithsonian Institution,
and by NSERC in Canada. The collaboration acknowledges the excellent work of the
technical support staff at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory and at the
collaborating institutions in the construction and operation of the instrument.
We are grateful to Trevor Weekes for his seminal contributions and leadership in
the field of VHE gamma-ray astrophysics, and for his interest in the wider
applications of IACTs.

2 data runs of 20 min of the Crab Nebula are provided for this project. They
were taken under good atmospheric conditions and high altitude (around 80 deg).

## License

The VERITAS data here provided as part of this repository are in a preliminary
data format. They are only meant for the user to reproduce the results within
the publication connected with this repository. It is not allowed to use the
data outside of this scope e.g. to make any claim on the source in any
scientific context (papers, conferences).

## Technical Details

The observations are performed in the so called ``wobble`` mode, with all 4
VERITAS telescopes pointing in parallel mode to the Crab Nebula with 0.5 degrees
from its nominal position. Event lists and IRFs were generated after a direction
cut of 0.1 deg in radius.
